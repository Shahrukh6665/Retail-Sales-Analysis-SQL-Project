# Retail-Sales-Analysis-SQL-Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis   
**Database**: `retail_db`

This project aims to showcase SQL skills and technique commonly used by data analysts for exploring, cleaning and analyzing retail sales data.
It includes setting up a retail sales database, conducting EDA, and addressing specific business questions through SQL queries.
This project is perfect for those beginning their data analysis journey and looking to establish a strong SQL foundation.

## Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `p1_retail_db`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `retail_sales` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE p1_retail_db;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,	
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,	
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,	
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;

SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
```

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

1. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05**:
```sql
SELECT 
    *
FROM
    retail_sales
WHERE
    sale_date = '2022-11-5';
```

2. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022**:
```sql
SELECT 
    *
FROM
    retail_sales
WHERE
    (Category = 'Clothing' AND quantity >= 4)
        AND sale_date BETWEEN '2022-11-01' AND '2022-11-30';
```

3. **Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.**:
```sql
SELECT 
    category,
    SUM(total_sale) AS net_sale,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM
    retail_sales
GROUP BY 
	category;
```

4. **Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.**:
```sql
SELECT 
    ROUND(AVG(age), 2) AS avg_age
FROM
    retail_sales
WHERE
    category = 'Beauty';
```

5. **Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.**:
```sql
SELECT 
    *
FROM
    retail_sales
WHERE
    total_sale > 1000;
```

6. **Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.**:
```sql
SELECT 
    gender, 
    category, 
    COUNT(transactions_id) as total_trans
FROM
    retail_sales
GROUP BY 
	gender , category
order by
	total_trans;
```

7. **Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year**:
```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(sale_date) AS year,
    MONTH(sale_date) AS month,
    ROUND(AVG(total_sale), 2) AS avg_sale
FROM
    retail_sales
GROUP BY 
	year , month
ORDER BY 
	avg_sale DESC;
```

```sql
SELECT
	year,
    month,
    avg_sale
FROM
(
	SELECT
		EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year,
        EXTRACT(MONTH from sale_date) AS month,
        ROUND(AVG(total_sale), 2) AS avg_sale,
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) AS ranks
	FROM
		retail_sales
	GROUP BY
		year, month        
) AS t1
WHERE
	ranks = 1;
```

8. **Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales **:
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id, 
    SUM(total_sale) AS total_sales
FROM
    retail_sales
GROUP BY 
	customer_id
ORDER BY 
	total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

9. **Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.**:
```sql
SELECT 
    category, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers
FROM
    retail_sales
GROUP BY 
	category;
```

10. **Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)**:
```sql
WITH hourly_sale
AS
(
SELECT
	*,
	CASE
		WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_date) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
        ELSE 'Evening'
	END AS shift
from
	retail_sales
 )   
 SELECT
	shift,
    count(*) as total_orders
FROM 
	hourly_sale
GROUP BY
	shift;
```

## Findings

- **Customer Demographics**: The dataset includes customers from various age groups, with sales distributed across different categories such as Clothing and Beauty.
- **High-Value Transactions**: Several transactions had a total sale amount greater than 1000, indicating premium purchases.
- **Sales Trends**: Monthly analysis shows variations in sales, helping identify peak seasons.
- **Customer Insights**: The analysis identifies the top-spending customers and the most popular product categories.

## Reports

- **Sales Summary**: A detailed report summarizing total sales, customer demographics, and category performance.
- **Trend Analysis**: Insights into sales trends across different months and shifts.
- **Customer Insights**: Reports on top customers and unique customer counts per category.

## Conclusion

The project provides a thorough introduction to SQL for data analyst, encompassing database setup, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and business focused SQL queries.
Insights from this project can support business decisions by revealing sales trends, customer behavior and product performance
